# AoE-3rd-excersises
Answers to excerises found in The Art of Electronics 3rd edition by Horowitz and Hill. Often considered the go-to literature on intuitive electronics, AoE contains a well documented wealth of knowledge on theoretical concepts with practical examples for an introduction to the field of electronic engineering. The book contains a vast number of exercises for the reader to test ones knowledge, however lacks a thorough document providing the much desirable answers for each example given. I hope to produce such a document that will provide an aid for future students of electronics.
